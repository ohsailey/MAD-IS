Introduction

With  natural  disasters  such  as  earthquakes,  typhoons,  and  floods,  etc.  occurringall around the world. Government as well as variousorganizations have built information systems  capable  of  supporting  preparedness  and  responses  of  frequent  disasters  of previously seen severities. In contrast, civilians are not as well informed, andprepared, as  they  should  be.  A  good  example  is visitors in  a  city  like  Taipei,  Taiwan  do  not know  much  about  the  emergency  response  and  evacuation  plans  laid  out  by  the authority. If a fierce earthquake or devastating flood strikes, they may not know what to do orwhere to go. 

In  fact,  information  about  locations  of  nearby  shelters  and  hospitalsconjointly  with ways  to  reach  them  during  emergencies  can  be  found  at  government  websites.  With todayâ€™s  prevalence  of  mobile  devices,  there  should  be  an  easy  way  for  people  to obtain this information for use during the emergency even when cellular networks and Internet   are   no   longer   functional.   Thus,   we   proposea   disaster   preparedness application called Mobile Assistant for Disasters (or MAD for short). The applications aimsto   enable   the   general   public   to   easilyretrieve   and   store   useful   disaster preparedness and response information on their phones. In short,MAD improves their personal safety when calamitous eventsoccur
