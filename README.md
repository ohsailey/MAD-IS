Introduction

With  natural  disasters  such  as  earthquakes,  typhoons,  and  floods,  etc.  occurringall around the world. Government as well as variousorganizations have built information systems  capable  of  supporting  preparedness  and  responses  of  frequent  disasters  of previously seen severities. In contrast, civilians are not as well informed, andprepared, as  they  should  be.  A  good  example  is visitors in  a  city  like  Taipei,  Taiwan  do  not know  much  about  the  emergency  response  and  evacuation  plans  laid  out  by  the authority. If a fierce earthquake or devastating flood strikes, they may not know what to do orwhere to go. In  fact,  information  about  locations  of  nearby  shelters  and  hospitalsconjointly  with ways  to  reach  them  during  emergencies  can  be  found  at  government  websites.  With today’s  prevalence  of  mobile  devices,  there  should  be  an  easy  way  for  people  to obtain this information for use during the emergency even when cellular networks and Internet   are   no   longer   functional.   Thus,   we   proposea   disaster   preparedness application called Mobile Assistant for Disasters (or MAD for short). The applications aimsto   enable   the   general   public   to   easilyretrieve   and   store   useful   disaster preparedness and response information on their phones. In short,MAD improves their personal safety when calamitous eventsoccur

MAD includes the following components:
====

•	IS (Interface Server): 
MAD-IS The Interface Server, where this is a stand-alone and powerful server, serving as an administrator, a data collector, and an information repository.
•	POS – Point of Service: 
These server are simple and ultra-light-weight server, ideal for pervasive deployment to points of services such as computer or smart devices that contributed by convenience stores, schools, hospitals, and another place. They act as data distribution points and can provide nearby users with location-specific disaster preparedness and response data and information through Internet, and use WIFI and local connections when Internet and phone lines are down.
•	Mobile Clients: 
MAD mobile client application can display information in a compact layout on user smart phones: The user can view the information either as a list or on a map. The list view make it easy for the user to search using either location name (i.e. Nangang Police Station) or location type (i.e. shelter, grocery store, etc), which is sorted by distance to current location and relevancy. The map view allows the user to see all the locations laid out on a map. There’s also a detail view, which presents detailed location information for the user.
